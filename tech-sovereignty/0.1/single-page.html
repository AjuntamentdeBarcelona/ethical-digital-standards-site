<h3 id="_objective"><a class="anchor" href="#_objective"></a>1.1. OBJECTIVE</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is a <strong>supporting document</strong> for the <strong>Code of Technological Practices</strong> that puts the concept of technological sovereignty into practice, expanding on the principles that govern the new directorate at the Barcelona Municipal Institute of Information Technology (IMI) in terms of technology and innovation: interoperability, agility, reuse, ethics and making knowledge and technologies more open.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document seeks to assist the IMI in implementing the strategic approach of the Barcelona City Council, which involves rolling out <strong>open technologies and free software</strong> for most of its technological processes and services.
This principle of technological sovereignty, combined with the <strong>agile methodology for developing services and responsible data management</strong>, form the basis of the medium-term vision for the agile digital transformation in the city of Barcelona.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the Paris Declaration on the Open Government Partnership, <em>“Open Source Software contributes to fostering transparency and collaboration. Source code is at the heart of digital and technical innovation. It is the primary means to providing high quality digital services. Partners joining will seek to promote transparency and accountability of open source code and algorithms they develop and use, wherever possible and appropriate. Partners joining will seek to design and implement them in non-discriminatory manners, and work towards maximizing the benefits of government code sharing and reuse.”</em>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, an important objective of this document is to help participants and those interested in the digital services of the Barcelona City Council to work with free technologies, solutions and projects; to understand the rights and duties resulting from free licences; to promote the development, acquisition, use and release of software; to ensure that its advantages are harnessed and to eliminate any reluctance that may exist due to the lack of knowledge around the various technical, organisational and legal aspects.</p>

<h2 id="_general_principles_of_technological_sovereignty"><a class="anchor" href="#_general_principles_of_technological_sovereignty"></a>2. General Principles of Technological Sovereignty</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 6 October 2016, the Commissioner for Technology and Digital Innovation presented the 2017–2020 Digital Barcelona Plan: Transition towards technological sovereignty, the goal of which is “to resolve the challenges of the city and its citizens through a more democratic use of technology.
Boosting technological and digital innovation, for a more open government, as a tool for developing a plural economy that promotes social and environmental transformation and that promotes citizen empowerment”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Plan, structured around three axes, demonstrates Barcelona&#8217;s desire to lead the transition towards technological sovereignty, a technological sovereignty of government and citizens that enables them to participate in the decision-making process and take action concerning the technological priorities and strategies in use throughout the city.
In particular, in terms of the government and city, the Plan focuses on a open and efficient government that uses technology to transform and digitally innovate the public sector based on free software standards.
Furthermore, the aim is to set up an open public data infrastructure to develop innovative data-based applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the Government Measure, technological sovereignty of government and citizens will make it possible to determine and take action concerning the priorities in the use of technology, make decisions about how to develop our city and regain knowledge of the city&#8217;s management using technological tools — knowledge that, to date, was held by just a few companies for the most part.
This sovereignty will make it possible to leave this knowledge as a lasting legacy for the city.
In addition, this technological sovereignty, promoted using free standards, must be a tool for the common good that generates a new economy and also makes knowledge-sharing possible between different cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the framework of this plan, in addition to designing public services as “digital services by default”, placing citizens at the centre of the design process and contributing public value, services must be built in the most agile and open manner possible; they must be simple, modular and interoperable to avoid dependencies on vendors and providers of specific proprietary solutions.
Consequently, the use of free software standards must be prioritised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Measure establishes the “transition towards free software and standards” as one of the most important activities: the transition towards free software standards, through the exploration of the best Spanish and European practices in this field.
To this end, a migration plan and a code of best practices for technology will be defined and established to guide the internal transformation, the reuse and sharing of the software with third parties and the development and use of shared government solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, technological sovereignty within the 2017-2020 Digital Barcelona Plan is structured around three fundamental principles:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transition and use of free software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interoperability of services and systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of free standards</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_concept_and_definitions"><a class="anchor" href="#_concept_and_definitions"></a>3.1. Concept and definitions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general principles underpinning free software are the concepts of <strong>freedom and access</strong>, basic principles of technological sovereignty: freedom to use software and access to the source code in order to benefit from this freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software is no different from other software in terms of its technical properties, although it is usually developed in a different manner.
Its distinguishing features are mainly its legal characteristics and the conditions of use and (re)distribution defined in the corresponding licence.
The use of free software is not subject to the same rules as traditional “proprietary” software for which a licence is required; these licences tend to establish strict limitations on the use of the software in question (per device, per installation or user name, per CPU, depending on the amount of data processed, etc.).
As a result, separate licences must be “bought” for their different uses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software differs from proprietary software in terms of the rights and “<strong>freedoms</strong>” awarded in the corresponding licences (“free licences”, many of which have also been called “open source licences”).
In summary, these rights provide for the <strong>free use, copying or modification of software and its redistribution to third parties,</strong> under specific conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A free licence is a licence that guarantees the “freedoms of the software”, according to Free Software Foundation (FSF).
An Open Source Software license is one that fulfils the guidelines established by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
From a technical and practical perspective, both the free software freedoms and the OSI Guidelines substantially overlap (while the philosophical views of the supporting institutions may be quite different).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Free Software Foundation defines free software as follows (1986)<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>: <em>A program is free software if the program&#8217;s users have the four essential freedoms:</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).</em> Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).</em> Access to the source code is a precondition for this</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, “open source” (or “open source software”) corresponds to software programs that are distributed under a licence that is free and fulfils the OSI guidelines set out under the Open Source Definition, which brings together and develops these four freedoms<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under this definition, licences must fulfil ten conditions to be considered as open source:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Free distribution: it may be sold or given away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code: must be included or must be freely available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derivative works: must allow the redistribution of modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrity of the author&#8217;s source code: licences may require that modifications may only be redistributed in patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against persons or groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against fields of endeavour: for example, commercial uses must not be excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licence distribution: the rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional licence by those parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licence must not be specific to a product: the program may not be licensed only as part of a larger distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licence must not place restrictions on other software: the licence must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licence must be technology-neutral.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These guidelines ensure, amongst other things, that a licence certified as being “open sources” grants to the user the aforementioned rights to exploit the software and, therefore, guarantees that it is on a non <strong>discriminatory basis</strong> and that licensees can <strong>access the source code.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legally speaking, there is no difference between the definition of free software and the open source guidelines.
This means, in any case and in terms of the licence, that the user can reproduce, transform (improve, adapt, integrate into other programs) and distribute or redistribute the programme and any resulting code for any purpose.
From a technical and practical perspective, both the free software freedoms and the OSI Guidelines substantially overlap (while the philosophical views of the supporting institutions may be quite different).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_copyleft"><a class="anchor" href="#_copyleft"></a>3.2. CopyLeft</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software licences with <em>copyleft</em> go beyond merely guaranteeing the basic four freedoms of the software for licensees or direct users.
A licence that awards the aforementioned rights without imposing conditions allows the licensee to include the free software in another software programme and redistribute the result under a restrictive or “proprietary” licence, in such a way that the users of the new programme will not attain any of the freedoms originally awarded.
In other words, there is no guarantee that the free software remains free.
Therefore, a mechanism was required to safeguard this freedom: <strong>copyleft</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The objective of this mechanism is to ensure that any software user is able to benefit from these freedoms at all times.
Free software licences with copyleft oblige licensees to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the same free licence for the redistribution of software (both the original unmodified software and any other modification made).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide or offer all users access to the source code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This dual condition eliminates any opportunity to distribute free software under a proprietary licence.
Noticeably, copyleft brings the two fundamental concepts of free software (and technological sovereignty) together: freedom and access.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_free_software_licences"><a class="anchor" href="#_free_software_licences"></a>3.3. Free software licences</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the general framework of these freedoms, there are a range of different ways to legally express them.
This, together with the variety of additional conditions that may be included, is the reason for there being almost ninety current and past licences classified as “free” by the FSF, many of which are also recognised as “open source” by the OSI, each with its own specific features.
The most important difference can be traced to the redistribution conditions and the extent of <em>copyleft</em>, which is usually used as a criteria for classifying or differentiating licences.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If the program has been licensed under a “<strong>permissive</strong>” license (such as BSD r X/MIT licenses), generally speaking, no conditions apply in terms of redistribution, which means it can be mixed with any other software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the program has been licensed under the GPL licence or another licence “<strong>with <em>copyleft</em></strong>”, then the redistribution of the programme or any other derivative or composite work including it, must be subject to the same licence, and offer the user access to the source code.
This ensures that the program remains “free” and cannot be “privatised”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some “intermediate” licences, or licences with “<em>*soft copyleft*</em>” (such as the LGPL, MPL or EUPL) make it possible to add or integrate new code into the original code and distribute the combination under a new licence (proprietary or free).
However, the original part must be offered under the original licence, normally along with the source code.
This is a form of partial <em>copyleft</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common and well-known licences are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Permissive: MIT, BSD, Apache Software License 2.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Copyleft:</em> GPLv2 and GPLv3, AferroGPL3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Weak (or “narrower”)</em> copyl<em>eft</em>: LGPL (version 2 or 3), MPL (version 2), CPL (Common Public License)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way of understanding the difference between permissive licenses and licences with <em>copyleft</em> is that they guarantee different types of freedoms:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>A permissive free software licence, such as the BSD or MIT licence, offers developers more freedom, as they can integrate and redistribute the software in deployments under both free and/or proprietary software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A free software licence with <em>copyleft</em> offers more freedom to the end users, as they will always receive applications with their source code and under a free software licence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_advantages"><a class="anchor" href="#_advantages"></a>3.4. Advantages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The legal and practical impact of free software licences is an important consideration.
The direct consequence of using software under a free software licence (and exercising the rights awarded thereby) is the ability to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Freely download and copy the program (often online, free of charge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install software to test it and assess its performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify it to adapt it to our needs (or hire a developer/ consultant to do this on our behalf).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install it on as many devices as necessary in our business or institution and update it as new versions are released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribute it (online or in CD/DVD format, etc.) so that others can benefit from any modification or improvement made.
All of the above without having to negotiate a licence with a supplier, sign exclusive support contracts or calculate the number of devices or users that will use the software in question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the main indirect advantages of the legal model for free software can be seen below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>Reuse:</strong> the right to run, modify and redistribute the free software implies that there is a much higher degree of use, both in terms of the components and whole applications by end users, which leads to a much higher degree of efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Independence:</strong> free access to the source code, along with the right to run and modify it, grants the user a high degree of independence from suppliers, meaning it is easier to demand more quality for the service provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> the right to access, execute and modify promotes collaborative software development (among developers who have potentially never met) and user-driven correction of errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service orientation:</strong> since they cannot “sell licences”, free software consultancy and development firms tend to base their business on the sale of services (selection, integration and deployment, support and maintenance, training, warranties, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communities:</strong> the rights granted by free software licences make for intense use and mass dissemination of free software online (in particular via repositories like SourceForge and GitHub) and promote the creation of communities dedicated to free software projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of freely distributing free software, no fee is charged: there is little point in setting a price when tomorrow, another user can legitimately publish the software (binary and source code) online for download by other internet users at no cost.
This prevents vendors trying to offer free software for a fee.
Redhat Inc., for example, can charge for its distribution of GNU/Linux (for example, Red Hat Enterprise) essentially because it offers additional products and services: performance warranties, support services, administrative or installation applications.</p>

<h3 id="_advantages_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_advantages_2"></a>4.2. Advantages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantages of the public administration using free software has been addressed countless times.
Without looking further, we would highlight the recommendations proposed to the Spanish Central State Administration on the use of free software, MAP, in June 2005.
In summary, this document outlines the following legal advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Obtaining sufficient software rights (control, on the one hand, and freedom, on the other) to optimise its management: updates, redistribution, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefiting from the freedom of internal and external copying and redistribution by the public administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing to the pooling and reuse of software amongst public administrations (IDA, national).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfying the legal framework for public action (effectiveness, efficiency, conversation, security, standardisation and interoperability, access and linguistic respect, reuse of resources).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These advantages have also been studied and presented by Cenatic, the Spanish National <em>Reference Centre for the Application of Open Source Information and Communication Technologies</em> (belonging to Red.es at the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda), for example, in its publication “<em>Diez razones para el uso de software de fuentes abiertas en la educación”</em> (Ten reasons to use open source software in education) or “<em>Diez razones para que la administración libere software”</em> (Ten reasons for the administration to release free software)<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup> it includes the following amongst the list of advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Independence from the software&#8217;s manufacturer: thanks to the free licence, public administrations and user companies can control the use of technology and enjoy more freedom in designing their future technology strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost savings: thanks to the sharing, reuse and absence of costs associated with free licences, there are significant savings in terms of the end price of applications, whilst using software that is 100% legal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater software security and quality: by publishing the source code, it makes it possible for the developer community to constantly contribute to the security and quality of the software, correcting any errors detected and thus helping the application evolve more quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of the local ICT sector: as they have access to the code, SMEs in the sector can offer services to public administrations and companies in such a way that they can compete under better conditions with other more dominant operators in the sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value generation in the community: using free software allows public administrations and companies to share and reuse applications, enhancing collaboration between these entities and with the technology industry and developer community.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_15" title="View footnote.">15</a>]</sup></p>

The resulting reuse makes it possible to enhance cost savings as part of the development, maintenance and evolution of the source code. However, primarily, it promotes the development of an economy based on knowledge and innovation, and contributes to the development of an information and communication technology ecosystem, improving the competition by encouraging cooperation between the public and private sector with the sole objective of improving public services, the quality of which are usually based on the mass use of information technologies.<br>

<h3 id="_legal_framework"><a class="anchor" href="#_legal_framework"></a>4.3. Legal framework</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is clear that Spanish public administrations are competent in terms of acquiring and using free software, exchanging it among themselves and releasing the software they own to the community.
In Spain, a number of general provisions tend to favour the use of free software in the public administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The most relevant was originally in Chapter III, Title IV of Law 11/2007, of 22 June, on electronic access of citizens to public services (LAECSP), entitled “Reuse of applications and technology transfer” (now <strong>Art. 157 and 158 of Law 40/2015)</strong>, which establishes measures that, without directly promoting free software, facilitate (a) the reuse of IT resources between administrations, (b) the <strong>creation of software repositories</strong> for subsequent reuse (such as the Technology Transfer Centre repository of the Spanish Central Government) and (c) the <strong>release</strong> of applications owned by public administrations under free licences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>the seventeenth additional provision of Law 57/2007</strong>, of 28 December, establishing Measures to Promote the Information Society, states that public administrations may make <strong>digital content</strong> available to the public for which there are no restrictions on intellectual property rights, or for which said rights are in the public domain, subject to licences that facilitate the study, copy and redistribution under the same terms (i.e., with a degree of <em>copyleft</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More importantly, <strong>Royal Decree 4/2010</strong>, of 8 January, regulating the National System of Interoperability in the scope of e-Government provides as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Article 16 establishes the licensing conditions applicable to reusable IT applications declared as “open source”, and in particular applications that can be redistributed to other users on the condition that the derivative work retains the previous conditions, in other words, with a degree of <em>copyleft</em> (weak or strong).
Furthermore, in terms of the release of software, Article 16 recommends the use of the EUPL licence, without prejudice to other licenses that guarantee the aforementioned rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Article 17 defines specific conditions applicable both to repositories of software for free reuse (in terms of their association with equivalent instruments at other public administrations) and the duty to consider solutions available to public administrations that may fully or partially satisfy the needs of new systems or services, improvements or updates to those already rolled out, and conditions in terms of the publication of the source code of IT applications in the aforementioned directories in order to promote sharing, reuse and collaboration in the pursuit of increased effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a regional level, for example, there is the <strong>Order, of 21 February 2005</strong>, on the public availability of the IT programmes of the Regional Government of Andalusia and its and its autonomous organisms, and more recently, <strong>Decree 159/2012, of 24 July</strong>, regulating the openness and reuse of IT platforms by the public administration in the Basque Country.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup> Both promote the use and reuse of free software and the creation of repositories to facilitate the aforementioned actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Italian Constitutional Court<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> has ruled that promoting free software based solutions does not distort competition nor is it against the public-sector procurement law (in Italy), since stipulating the legal conditions for supplying software (the free software licence) and does not amount to technological, trademark or provider discrimination, rather is a legal condition in the specifications that all suppliers must fulfil.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The various laws to which Barcelona City Council is subject does not exclude nor require the use of free software within the Administration; however, some of the criteria established for acquiring software, such as the promotion of reuse or the need for interoperability, are achieved more effectively, consistently and in a more lasting way with free software licencing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_public_procurement_of_free_software"><a class="anchor" href="#_public_procurement_of_free_software"></a>4.4. Public Procurement of Free Software</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of the conditions for acquiring technologies for the administrations’ digital services as free software or free software-based applications, although no European country makes it mandatory to use free software, most ban discrimination against providers that submit bids involving free software, based on the principles of free competition and non-discrimination.
However, they do require that supplied software complies with open and internationally recognised standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other regulatory frameworks establish a preference for the use of free technologies.
In 2014, for example, the Italian government promoted free solutions, establishing an order of priority in terms of the analysis of proposals: administrations must give preference to free solutions over proprietary software and cloud solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Spain, software and software-related services supplied to the public administrations are primarily regulated by the Royal Legislative Decree 3/2011, of 14 November, approving the revised text of the public-sector procurement law (recently updated).
Beyond the standard public procurement procedures (specifications, bids, awards, enforcement and resolution, etc.), the following points are important in terms of free software:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This law considers the provision of “base” or standard software (belonging to third parties) as a supply, whilst tailor-made individual developments are considered services (Art. 9 and 10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second case, the service provider (of the development) must transfer the rights of the modifications and customisations and other developments delivered under the contract to the public administration, unless established otherwise in the administrative specifications (Art. 301).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also worth noting that Article 17 of Royal Decree 4/2010, of 8 January, obliges administrations to consult the repositories and existing reusable solutions before procuring a new technology.</p>

<h3 id="_licences_for_freeing_public_administration_software"><a class="anchor" href="#_licences_for_freeing_public_administration_software"></a>4.5. Licences for freeing public administration software</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Article 16 of the aforementioned Royal Decree 4/2010, of 8 January, establishes four conditions for Spanish public administrations to follow when releasing software:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>In terms of the applications certified as open source, administrations shall use licences that guarantee that the programmes, data or information shared:</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p><em>Can be executed for any purpose.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Allow for the source code to be consulted.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be modified or improved.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be redistributed to other users either with or without changes, provided that the derivative work preserves the same four guarantees.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>To this end, they shall procure the use of the European Union Public Licence, without prejudice to other licences that guarantee the same rights as those set out in sections 1 and 2.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that a public administration can use any current free software licence, provided that it contains an element of copyleft (condition 2(d) above) and it is “recommended” to use the EUPL licence.
For releasing software by the European Commission or the EU and, by extension, other public administrations, a study was carried out in 2005 and it was established that no existing free licence was ideal, even though many may serve the purpose.
Therefore, in 2007 (and updated in 2017), the <em>European Union Public Licence</em> (EUPL) was published, which is a licence with weak <em>copyleft</em>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_18" title="View footnote.">18</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<td class="content">
The EUPL is a particularly interesting licence given its appendix on “compatible” or “interoperable licences”. To avoid licence conflicts, the EUPL allows licensees to redistribute derivative works (and combinations or composites) under a compatible licence or under an incompatible licence indicated in the appendix (including the Eclipse PL, OSL 2.0 and 3.0, CeCILL, LGPLv2.1 and GPLv2 and now GPLv3 and AGPLv3). This express compatibility and the interoperability policy is applied to the final result of any integration (and not the original components that retain their own licence). Therefore, these terms of interoperability respect the original licence, whilst permitting interoperability with other, normally incompatible, copyleft licences.

<h2 id="_interoperability_free_standards_and_formats"><a class="anchor" href="#_interoperability_free_standards_and_formats"></a>5. Interoperability, free standards and formats</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interoperability is the capacity of different information systems, possibly from different providers, to work together and share information without technical or legal boundaries.
A more detailed definition of <em>interoperability</em> and its different scopes (organisational, semantic, technical and temporary) is available in the glossary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standards or norms are in place to facilitate interoperability between different products of companies in the market.
When the norms are controlled by only part or some of them, this tends to lead to market domination.
To prevent this phenomenon, the freedom of using and implementing standards in any form that is deemed appropriate by users and developers must be guaranteed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally speaking, a standard is a rule or specification on specific engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes or practices, generally achieved via the consensus of the interested parties.
Normally, rules are created by formal organisations like the ITU, ISO, IETF, W3C, OASIS, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By adopting a free standard for a digital service, the administration and its end users are not limited to resorting to a specific provider and this decreases vendor lock-in; therefore, it is possible to increase the user&#8217;s options and as a result, the market is more competitive in terms of the technologies and solutions that comply with the standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has been argued that a free standard is more than a mere specification.
A free standard is “free” on the basis of its underlying principles and the way in which it has been developed publicly and been approved and, therefore, is accessible.
It is governed by a process of collaboration and consensus.
A free standard is generally based on the principle that it is available so that each user can gain access, read and implement it without royalties or costs.
It has been argued that a minimum or “reasonable” fee (for example, for a standardisation organisation to ensure compliance) could be enforced, which must be reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND).
However, to many this is unacceptable, as it inhibits, for example, deployments in free software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Barcelona City Council believes that the use of free standards:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promotes interoperability and compatible integration between the multiple information systems and data series of the City Council, both internally and those interrelated with other external data and systems.
Therefore, free standards are a prerequisite for technological neutrality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishes standard rules and reduces the differences between technical specifications, creating a level playing field, which decreases obstacles to the development and provision of competitive services locally, regionally and internationally, catalysing innovation whilst reducing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates greater synergy in terms of regional and international collaboration in the IT sector and in particular concerning the publication and exchange of data between different services and entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guarantees that information generated digitally at a specific moment in time will be readable and reusable in the future (regardless of the programmes used to generate or read this information).
Thus, open, public specifications safeguard the preservation, longevity, integrity and reuse of information without restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces overlaps, allowing interdependent systems and entities to work together to complete or fulfil a process at a lower cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates interaction between citizens and public administrations and private entities, as no specific software provider has to be used.
A company or person using software based on free standards will never be obliged to purchase competing software to exercise their right to communicate with the public administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensures the representation of more interests in the sector, thus ensuring continuous improvement, support, competition between providers and greater flexibility between technological options.
This reduces the risk assumed by the City Council, in such a way that its users adopt the free standard specifications when the City Council&#8217;s systems are integrated with those of its providers, citizens and other partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes the use of free software, as the production process consists of defining publicly available specifications.
The availability of its source code also promotes an open and democratic debate in terms of the specifications, making them more robust and interoperable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The City Council believes that the minimum characteristics for a specification and its associated documentation for them to be considered free standards are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rule is adopted and shall be maintained by a non-profit organisation and its continuous development is structured around an open decision-making procedure available to all the interested parties (consensual protection of privacy in the e-communication sector or majority decision).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rule has been published and the standard specifications are available free of charge or for a nominal fee.
It must available for copying, distribution and use by anyone, free of charge or for a nominal fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any intellectual or industrial property right surrounding the standard (for example, possible patents) is licensed to users free from royalties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no restrictions on the use and reuse of the standard.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The City Council&#8217;s policy in terms of free software seeks to harness, insofar as possible, the benefits of the free software development model, both in terms of the general technological sovereignty objective and on the grounds of economies and technological quality.
Therefore, the main elements of this aspect of the City Council&#8217;s technological sovereignty policy are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To facilitate and promote the effective and efficient use of free software at the City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reusing existing software and facilitate the reuse of the City Council&#8217;s software by third parties, both amongst administrations and other individuals and institutions (under free licences).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To migrate the City Council&#8217;s systems to free solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contribute and participate in free software communities, with a particular emphasis on local communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure respect for the rights of the City Council and third parties, in particular those of developers and members of the free software community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the City Council has access to the source code of its applications, in addition to the rights of reproduction, modification and distribution inherent to free licences, its independence from specific providers and the future maintenance and sustainability of municipal systems is guaranteed.
Furthermore, a free software-based system is particularly useful when building services to be used by different municipal institutions and that can be shared with other administrations as well as with the wider user community.
Public access to the source code is also a guarantee of transparency in terms of particularly important or sensitive systems, such as, for example, electronic voting or tax calculation systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along these lines, the main elements of this policy, as defined in the Code of Technological Practices, can be seen below.
We will discuss each element in more detail, offering explanations and guidance for their implementation.</p>

<p>In the event that solutions based on proprietary software are proposed, it must be demonstrated that they fulfil the exceptional conditions set out under “Acquisition” subparagraph above, and that therefore the use of the proprietary software is the only viable option.

<li>

<li>
<p>Specify the possible impact on the interoperability of the system with other systems and platforms and the possible vendor lock-in that may occur as a result.
Actions to mitigate these impacts must also be proposed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The city&#8217;s model for technological sovereignty seeks to prevent dependency on a single provider, which is also a key factor in increasing the capacity for innovation in public services.
Wherever possible, the procurement of digital services must increase the diversity of providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most innovative and effective free software projects require a community of stakeholders that is effectively managed, participating in and contributing towards the evolution and sustainability of the software.
The IMI will follow community principles of sustainability, openness, transparency and participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factors to be taken into account include the governance of the community and the technical management of these projects, including the approval of the code for its inclusion in the project and the definition of requirements and the corresponding roadmap.
The diversity of contributions shall be encouraged, although for critical projects, the IMI shall retain effective control over technical developments financed using public funds.</p>

<p>To integrate as much as possible valuable, high-quality contributions insofar as possible (in terms of both code and bug fixes, etc. and documentation) coming from parties other than the City Council&#8217;s activities and those of its contractors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure that all contributions have sufficient technical quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the legal integrity of the contributions (ensuring that third party intellectual property is not included by mistake or incorrectly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prioritise contributions that favour achieving Barcelona City Council&#8217;s objectives or the objectives of other institutions sponsoring the project and, in any case, accept only those that do not hinder this process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all projects that are freed, documents required to facilitate the development and deployment of the software by third parties must be included in project&#8217;s repository (in line with free project practices: for example, <em>Readme, Install, Contributing, Roadmap</em> files etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions management shall include a protocol for contributions and management of the corresponding rights, in particular to ensure that third party intellectual property is not included by mistake or incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure that the requirements for contributing code are strictly technical, bureaucratic barriers to contributions must be minimised.
With this objective in mind, instructions shall be provided on project programming styles and standards and how to make contributions from a legal perspective (as explained under “Intellectual property” and “Legal management” below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure that contributions are traceable and that fragments of code that may pose a legal risk can be eliminated, as the case may be, all contributions that are ultimately included in the product must be signed by a party authorised by project maintainers in accordance with the protocol for a Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO), as is the case for the Linux kernel and many other free projects.</p>

<p>The extra (short-term) costs corresponding to making these contributions to the original project (upstreaming) are justified by the fact that, that once changes have been made, the new functionalities or improvements are maintained by the entire community working on the project.
Furthermore, this also ensures the quality of changes that are introduced and compatibility with future changes made by third parties.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With respect to intellectual property rights, the City Council contemplates both the traditional figure of assignment of rights in new developments to the City Council as well as the option of allowing providers to retain ownership of rights in the results, provided that they release the software under a free software licence.
This promotes local industry and the reuse of resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general rule, the accumulation of intellectual property at the IMI shall be avoided and, where applicable, software and acquired solutions should be freed or their reuse permitted.
Therefore, when appropriate, intellectual property rights in developments shall not be transferred in full to the IMI by providers or other contributors, so that these developments can be recycled for other projects, provided that the IMI can reuse, combine or modify the software generated and, if applicable, release it under a free software license.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To facilitate and speed up the deployment and reuse of applications, each technological project managed by the IMI shall establish a clear legal framework for managing intellectual and industrial property rights, the use of components under different licences and contributions to the project, clearly identifying the owner of the rights in the software and the scope and characteristics of any license or assignment of rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>External contributions outside the scope of the supply or service contract will require a formal process to support rights management, whether under an agreement that assigns rights to the City Council, or in the form of the project licence or a contributor licence agreement (CLA) or a Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO), to ensure that third party intellectual property is not included by mistake.</p>
